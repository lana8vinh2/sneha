  <h1>HAPPY 21ST BIRTHDAY SNEHA!!!! тЩея╕П</h1>
  <p>Originally I wrote a note... but that's <em>soooooo</em> 2010. So I have incorparated the note into this html only site...
    Sorry... I only know HTML ATM but imagine how beautiful this site would of been if I wasn't lazy with my learning lol. Also just a note - The dimensions of the photos are off cuz dunno how to scale and too lazy to maths AND I can't get videos to work for some reason AND thus can't share the multitude of A+ vids, so if u have any tips holla at me. ЁЯСНЁЯП╝</p>
  <p> I remember the first time we met, where I was in my room and had red velvet cake that my parents had left behind and I needed someone to help me eat it. THAT was your only and original role. Jk. I needed a friend in uni. aNd GoD pROvIdeD mE WIth
    oNe. Always grateful
    that you were my first friend in uni and that you will forever be in my life until the day we DIE. Sorry that I scared u at first lmao. I can be very intimidating even though i'm the size of a troll.
    When Emily said you said I was scary on the bus home from the cinemas in year 2, it really upset me because I was thinking... Wow I was trying to make a friend and I was scary?!? BUT Honestly, can't blame ya, I am pretty ferocious.
    Honestly though, our friendship history is SO RICH, thank you for sticking by me! With all of it's ups and downs. WoW what a ride.</p>
  <p> I looked through my photo storage and this is apparently our first photo debut together ЁЯШо</p>
